## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
Archival methods and best practices are designed specifically to allow repositories to efficiently manage tremendous volumes of materials. Repositories can easily contain tens of thousands of cubic feet of physical materials where everything should be discoverable and retrievable.Existing archival description methods and best practices are a perfect fit for addressing these challenges. Archivists must describe digital materials hierarchically by prioritizing aggregate groups of materials first, and further describing materials more granularly based on user needs and available resources. This is the only way archivists can grapple with ever-larger volumes of materials they need to make discoverable. Archival approaches can also readily incorporate new methods to automate description from digital records.  

Automated metadata creation is necessary to manage large volumes of digital records, but archivists must also account for the risks in these methods of perpetuating biases and generating inaccurate or incomplete information that will always reduce the quality of automated metadata. Hierarchical description allows archivists to manage these risks by supplementing automated description at lower levels with higher quality upper level description directly created by professional archivists.

There is also some intriguing potential for indexing that inherited description along with the digital object at a lower weight. In many cases, this existing description could be sufficient for discovery without the need to create a more detailed metadata record for a digital repository. This would often make digitization viable where it otherwise would not be feasible. This should include digitization requests made by users, allowing repositories to slowly digitize their most requested items over time. Arclight would also allow the creation of more detailed metadata records, when archivists have user-driven reasons to increase discoverability â€“ consistent with archival description best practices as stated in the DACS Statement of Principles.

Using Arclight as a single system for both archival description and digital materials will enable repositories to apply the same archival methods and best practices that work well for large volumes of physical materials to digital materials. Instead of requiring detailed metadata records for every digital object, this will empower practitioners to use their professional judgment to match their limited time and resources to best meet user needs like they do for physical materials. This model also makes it possible to provide integrated access to born-digital materials, which often include large volumes of files that must be described in aggregate. Emerging methods of automated description are necessary to manage this volume, and archival hierarchy helps to mitigate the risks of these methods by connecting automated description with professional quality metadata records created by humans.

Using Arclight as a common platform for description and digital objects also allows repositories to maintain the important connections between these records. Due to current system limitations, many repositories nationwide currently digitize items and separate them from existing description to place them in incompatible digital repositories which risks losing the valuable archival context that preserves how these materials were created and used. Using Arclight for both description and digital objects allows repositories to maintain these important relationships.
