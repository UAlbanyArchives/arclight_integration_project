## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The University at Albany Libraries, together with the Empire State Library Network (ESLN), are further developing ArcLight into a single platform for digital archives and special collections materials. Supported by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) National Leadership Grants for Libraries program, this project will enable ArcLight to provide discovery and access to digital materials, metadata, and full-text content using International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) manifests alongside archival description traditionally contained in finding aids.

### 1.4 Requirements
The key words “MAY”, “MUST”, “MUST NOT” ,“RECOMMENDED”, “REQUIRED”, “OPTIONAL”, “SHOULD”, and “SHOULD NOT” in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) [RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.5 Terminology
The following terms have precise definitions as used in this documnent:

**version:** The unique individual object that is uploaded to Hyrax is the version. There can be multiple versions of the same object, but there are enough discrepencies in the content to justify creating another digital object with its own unique identifier, instead of uploading multiple objects to the same ID. File format changes do not qualify as a large enough discrepency. For the preexisting digital objects in our current system, there will be at least one version folder with accompanying metadata. The new system will create another version utilizing the metadata and the new IIIF formatsw. Both will be saved for historical data and review.

**format:** There are various forms that files can appear in. For example, a document can appear as a ".docx" file and/or a ".pdf" file or an image could appear as a ".jpg" file and/or a ".png" file. There is no difference in the content of the object, rather the extenesion that it was created, saved, or changed to.  

**representative image:** or **thumbnail:** The thumbnail image previews the IIIF file of the digital object. It is a representative image of the file, otherwise referred to as a "smaller version" of the object, but tneither of these descriptions should beconfused with the definitions of "representation" or "version" seen above. Though thumbnails will be included in the metadata files for the migration, they do nots serve the same purpose as the representation or version files. 

**NOID:** Stands for "Nice opaque identifier generator commands" [NOID] (https://metacpan.org/dist/Noid/view/noid) that creates globally unique names for identification. For objects taht currently exist on the "archives.albany.edu" website, Hyrax has generated these identifiers, and they will be transitioned with the preexisiting identifiers to the new system. Any new objects uploaded after the transition will be given NOIDs generated by our system.

## 2. Overview

1. The collection folder MUST start with "apap" "ger" "mss" or "ua" and be followed by a combination of three numbers. If the collection begins with "ua" the three numbers MAY also be followed by a period and an additional three numbers.

## 3.Examples

Folder structure within the SPE_DAO folder will be as follows: (I don't know if this should go here?) 

└── SPE_DAO

    └── collection folder
    
            └── NOID
            
                ├── version folder
                
                │   ├── format folder
                
                │   ├── format folder
                
                │   └── format folder
                
                ├── content.hocr
                
                ├── content.txt
                
                ├── content.vtt
                
                ├── manifest.json
                
                ├── metadata. yml
                
                └── thumbnail.jpg

The format folders will be named after the corresponding file extension suchas ".pptx" ".docx" ".pdf" etc. In the above structure several objects may exist within a single object (such as multiple different photos within a single pdf), all files will appear in the files that are most appropriate. The "original file" will be saved in the format folder that matches its type, and the Hyrax-generated PDF file will appear in the PDF folder. 

An example of several digital objects being linked to a single archival object can be found below:
