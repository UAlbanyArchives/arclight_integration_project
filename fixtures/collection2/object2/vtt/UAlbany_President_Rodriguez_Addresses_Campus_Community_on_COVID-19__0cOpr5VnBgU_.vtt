00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hello, I wanted to speak with you to make sure you are aware of the latest updates on

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
you Albany's response to COVID-19.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This is a fast-moving situation and frequent updates are necessary.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Yesterday, you received an email from me explaining that after spring break on March 23rd, all

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
you Albany classes will be delivered remotely.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This morning, you received notice that we suspended classes today, Thursday.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This was done as precaution after we learned of a confirmed case of COVID-19 in our campus

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
community.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This individual will remain isolated from the campus population until they have been

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
cleared by public health officials.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We are working closely with the Albany County Department of Health to reach out to any student,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
faculty or staff member who may have come in contact with this individual.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Also, as a precaution, we have closed the business building today for cleaning.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
As I said, these fast-changing circumstances are going to continue to require frequent

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
updates.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It is very important that you continue to monitor your email for updates today, tomorrow,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and throughout spring break.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Please exercise caution regarding information you may see about the virus on social media,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
especially as it relates to our campus community.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Our county and state health departments provide the only official confirmation of any communicable

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
disease, including COVID-19.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
For additional information, please visit COVID-19 information page on our website.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
For those of you who are leaving for spring break, please travel safely and everyone, please

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
continue to follow proper safety protocols.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Wash your hands frequently, use hand sanitizer, cough and sneeze into your elbow or sleeve,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
avoid large gatherings, stay home if you are sick, and maintain as much social distance

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
as possible.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Let us continue to make sure that all members of our community are treated with the care,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
dignity, and respect that we all deserve.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Be safe, be well, stay healthy, and again, please watch your emails, text, and the official

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
UAlbany social media channels for ongoing updates.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
As the great-deng family, we will get through this together.
